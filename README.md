# COVID-19-LFD-IBM

Here we provide the source code and testing script for the individual based model presented in the paper entitled "A general computational framework for COVID-19 modelling, with applications to testing varied interventions in education environments". All scripts were written and tested in MATLAB 2020b.

The GeneralDelayLFT is the script describing our main algorithm of COVID-19 infection spread through a compartmental discrete population. The user is able to set a vast array of simulation parameters, we advise the reader to see the occupanying manuscript for full parameter options. The algorthim also includes the option to add various interventions to mitigate the spread of infection. We also provide a test script to run simulations, presenting each of the input parameters.
